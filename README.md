# scienceburks

This is a mockup teacher site I created and am currently working on. Very topical while we have students utilizing online learning!

 It uses WordPress for CMS, React, and a framework called Frontity to combine the two.

The production environment is hosted on Vercel here: (https://scienceburks.vercel.app/)

### Framework Used

This project was bootstrapped with [Frontity](https://frontity.org/).

#### TO-DO:

- User authentication, User creation
- Point scoring system for students
- Footer drop down functionality
- Log out / Log in functionality

#### As a node app

Use `npx frontity serve` to run it like a normal Node app.

This command generates (and runs) a small web server that uses the generated `server.js` and `/static` to serve your content

#### As a serverless service

Upload your `static` folder to a CDN and your `server.js` file to a serverless service, like Now or Netlify.
